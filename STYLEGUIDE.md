# Essential Guide to Election Security Style Guide

The Essential Guide to Election Security&ndash;referred to here as the Guide&ndash;is developed on GitHub and published on [Read The Docs](https://readthedocs.org). Each section deals with a specific type of file, but all files within the repository should:

* Have an encoding of UTF-8.
* Have line endings of LF (as opposed to CRLF).
* Have trailing white space removed from the end of lines.
* End with a blank line.
* Use spaces instead of tabs (NB: see the file-type specific section for how many spaces should be used for indentations).
* End lines with punctuation. Typically this is a '.' unless preceding a list, when it is a ':'.

## Terminology

* Unless grammatically problematic, use 'actor' or 'threat actor' rather than 'attacker' or 'adversary'.
* Unless factually problematic, use EI-ISAC rather than CIS when referring to what 'we' do.
* The singular possessive of CIS is CIS's.

## ReST Files

ReStructuredText does allow for some variability in how certain content is rendered. To mitigate any consistency issues, please follow the these conventions when developing content for the guide.

### Indentation

Unless otherwise necessary for white-space-specific strutural reasons, indentation should be two spaces.

### Lists

#### Unordered lists

Unordered lists can be generated with hyphens (-), addition sign (+), and asterisks (\*). For the Guide, please only use asterisks. There should only be a single space between the list character (i.e., asterisk) and the list item content.

##### Correct

```rst
* List item 1
* List item 2
* List item 3
```

Note that sublists must be spaced from the main list with blank lines _and_ the sublist asterisk **must** line up under the first letter of the outer list item.

```rst
* List item 1
* List item 2

  * Sublist item 1
  * Sublist itme 2

* List item 3
```

##### Incorrect

The following list uses hyphens instead of asterisks.

```rst
- List item 1
- List item 2
- List item 3
```

The list item content is separated by two spaces from the list character.

```rst
*  List item 1
*  List item 2
*  List item 3
```

The inner list below would render as a blockquote containing a list instead of the intended sublist.

```rst
* List item 1
* List item 2

    * Sublist item 1
    * Sublist itme 2

* List item 3
```

#### Ordered lists

Ordered lists can be rendered by typing the individual list-item numbers followed by periods (e.g., 1., 2., 3.)  or the numbers of the list can be auto-generated by using the hash symbol followed by a period (i.e., #.). In most cases, the hash symbol option should be used for ease and maintainability.

##### Correct

```rst
#. List item 1
#. List item 2
#. List item 3
```

The following will render an auto-numbered sublist based on cascading style sheet (CSS) rules.

```rst
#. List item 1
#. List item 2

  #. Sublist item 1
  #. Sublist itme 2

#. List item 3
```

##### Incorrect

The following list uses explicit numbers instead of the auto-numbering method and should be avoided unless there is a compelling reason for explicitly numbering the list.

```rst
1. List item 1
2. List item 2
3. List item 3
```

The list item content is separated by two spaces from the list characters (i.e., the hash and period)..

```rst
#.  List item 1
#.  List item 2
#.  List item 3
```

Similar to the incorrect unordered list example, the inner list below would render as a blockquote containing a list, but it would also have the additional unintended side effect of breaking the numbering sequence (i.e., "List item 3" would be preceded by a "1.").

```rst
#. List item 1
#. List item 2

    * Sublist item 1
    * Sublist itme 2

#. List item 3
```

### Links

ReST&ndash;with Sphinx extensions&ndash;has a large number of ways to reference hyperlinks, files, text sections, and other types of content. For specificity and maintainability, explicit ways of referencing content should be prioritized over implicit options.

#### External links

When adding links to off-site content, for single links, the linked text and the link should use the [embedded URI form](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris-and-aliases). If the same text requiring the same link appears in a document multiple times, the _fold-in_ form should be used.

##### Correct

```rst
This is an example of the `embedded URI form <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris-and-aliases>`_
```

```rst
Implement a `CIS Benchmark`_ for firewall management. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Look at the `CIS Benchmark`_ for firewall management.

.. _CIS Benchmark: https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/
```

##### Incorrect

The underscore has to end the backtick-ed string, otherwise the link won't render.

```rst
This is an example of the _`embedded URI form <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#embedded-uris-and-aliases>`
```

With only one link, it's better to put the link closer to the text that will require it (i.e., use the embedded form).

```rst
Implement a `CIS Benchmark`_ for firewall management. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

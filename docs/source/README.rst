   **SOFT LAUNCH DRAFT VERSION. CONTENT NOT FINALIZED**

.. note:: This is a pre-release, draft version of this Guide. We're calling it a soft launch, but it's more of an 'open review period.'

    We welcome feedback. It will be continually updated as we move toward a formal launch of the site in Summer 2022. Feel free to contact us at |eges_email|. Thank you!

The Essential Guide to Election Security
===============================================

A Best Practices Resource for Election Professionals
--------------------------------------------------------

As a follow-on to `The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security <https://www.cisecurity.org/elections>`_, the `Center for Internet Security <https://cisecurity.org>`_ (CIS) has developed this Essential Guide to Election Security to serve as a first-stop resource for election officials to learn about best practices in election security. This can aid the process of building a program designed to meet individual needs and abilities of any given election office.

When the Handbook was published in 2018, election officials had much less guidance to rely on. Today, they have an enormous amount of guidance they need to navigate. With so much guidance and so many tools and approaches available, it's difficult for any given election official to know what will best work for them.

This Guide considers the wide range of technical capabilities and resource availability among the many thousands of election offices in the United States. While providing guidance for all organizational maturities, it emphasizes designing guidance for small jurisdictions without extensive cybersecurity resources available to them. The most important practices are included for those jurisdictions, with opportunities to ramp up as they mature.

Why does this Guide look like a webpage? (Or does it??)
-------------------------------------------------------

You might be reading this online. Or you might be reading a PDF. If the latter, it's because your PDF was built from an online version. Here's why we're keeping all of the content for the Guide online:

CIS published The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security in early 2018, just before the `Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center <bp/join_ei_isac.rst>`_ (EI-ISAC) launch.

In 2021, CIS began working with the election community to update that Handbook. A common item of feedback we received was that the static nature of the Handbook meant it didn't include any of new and evolving the best practices that weren't already in place in early 2018.

Creating an updated version of that Handbook would've left us in the same position: the pace of new best practices and services available to secure election infrastructure is too rapid to rely on a static model for communicating them to election officials.

Instead, we decided to create this dynamic, always up-to-date online Guide. It can still be exported as one big PDF, but when you do so, you will get the best practices current as of the moment you hit the button to create the PDF.

We can also embed and link to more engaging content like videos and examples. When best practices change, officials face new risks, or different resources become available, we can quickly update the Guide to reflect the new state of the world.

Who should use this Guide?
----------------------------

This Guide helps election officials and their staffs understand their organization's cybersecurity readiness and take steps to improve. It is for jurisdictions of all of sizes and types, though which best practices apply to you will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to:

* The type of jurisdiction (state vs. county vs. municipality),
* The structure of election administration in a given state (top-down vs. bottom-up),
* The types of election equipment owned, and
* How IT responsibilities are shared with other functions in the jurisdiction, such as when IT is shared with the rest of the county.

Election technology providers and other stakeholders will also find much of the information useful as they consider how their work impacts outcomes in election administration and security.

How do I use this Guide?
----------------------------

The Guide is organized into several sections:

#. An introduction,
#. A description of :doc:`maturities <maturity/maturities>` and how they are used in the document,
#. A set of :doc:`best practices <bp/bp_intro>` for organizations to implement, and
#. Additional references, tools, and related information.

You can get more detailed information the Essential Guide in our :doc:`how to <appendices/how_to_guide>`.

Identifying Your Organization's Security Lead
--------------------------------------------------------

Whether you work in a small resource-constrained office or a large well-staffed and resourced office, one of the most effective steps to increasing your security posture is identifying someone who you'll hold accountable for making progress in examining your current maturity status, maintaining existing security processes, implementing best practices, and taking additional steps towards increasing your security posture.

This individual should own and maintain the process of improving your cybersecurity posture, whether you use this Guide to do so or any other resource. Accountability matters!


A Little Encouragement Before You Start
--------------------------------------------------------

Many elections officials may not consider themselves security or IT professionals. This Guide takes this into consideration. In addition to implementing the best practices for your maturity, we encourage you to read through the entire Guide. It can provide you an understanding of the types of actions you may want to take as you continually improve your cybersecurity posture.

Regardless of your current expertise level in this area, there is always capacity for growth, both in our own abilities and in the support of peers and colleagues. If you find yourself not understanding something, be empowered to reach out to the CIS elections, the CIS elections team, and trusted partners and peers at the Federal, State and Local levels for guidance and support.

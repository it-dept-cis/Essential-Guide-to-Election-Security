The Essential Guide to Election Security
===============================================

A Best Practices Resource for Election Professionals
--------------------------------------------------------

As a follow-on to The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has developed the Essential Guide to Election Security to serve as a first-stop resource for election officials to learn about best practices in election security. This can aid the process of building a program designed to meet individual needs and abilities of any given election office.

When the Handbook was published in 2018, election officials had much less guidance to rely on. Today, they have an enormous amount of guidance they need to navigate. With so much guidance and so many tools and approaches available, which is best for any given jurisdiction? This Guide considers the wide range of technical capabilities and resource availability among the many thousands of election offices in the United States. While providing guidance for all organizational maturities, it emphasizes designing guidance for small jurisdictions without extensive cybersecurity resources available to them. The most important practices are included for those jurisdictions, with opportunities to ramp up as they mature.

Why does this Guide look like a webpage?
----------------------------------------------

CIS published The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security in early 2018, just before the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC) launch. In 2021, CIS began working with the election community to update that Handbook. One of the primary pieces of feedback we received was that the static nature of the Handbook meant it didn't include any of new and evolving the best practices that weren't already in place in early 2018.

Creating an updated version of that Handbook would've left us in the same position: the pace of new best practices and services available to secure election infrastructure is too rapid to rely on a static model for communicating them to election officials.

Instead, we decided to create this dynamic, always up-to-date online Guide. It can still be exported as one big PDF, but when you do so, you will get the best practices current as of the moment you hit the button to create the PDF.

We can also embed and link to more engaging content like videos and examples. When best practices change, officials face new risks, or different resources become available, we can quickly update the Guide to reflect the new state of the world.

Who should use this Guide?
----------------------------

This Guide helps election officials and their staffs understand their organization's cybersecurity readiness and take steps to improve. It is for jurisdictions of all of sizes and types, though which best practices apply to you will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to:

* the type of jurisdiction (state vs. county vs. municipality),
* the structure of election administration in a given state (top-down vs. bottom-up),
* the types of election equipment owned, and
* how IT responsibilities are shared with other functions in the jurisdiction, such as when IT is shared with the rest of the county.

Election technology providers and other stakeholders will also find much of the information useful as they consider how their work impacts outcomes in election administration and security.

How do I use this Guide?
----------------------------

The Guide is organized into several sections:

#. An introduction,
#. A description of :doc:`maturities <Maturity/maturities` and how they are used in the document,
#. A set of :doc:`best practices <BPs/bp_intro>` for organizations to implement, and
#. Additional references, tools, and related information.

You can get more detailed information the Essential Guide in our :doc:`how to <Appendices/how_to_guide>`.

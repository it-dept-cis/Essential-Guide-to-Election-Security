     Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation

   common vulnerabilities and exploits
     The generic name for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities that have been catalogued by the `CVE program <https://www.cve.org>`_. There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog.

     Safeguards implemented through software to protect end-user machines such as workstations and laptops against attack (e.g., antivirus, antispyware, anti-adware, personal firewalls, host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems, etc.)

   Implementation Group

   malicious domain blocking and reporting

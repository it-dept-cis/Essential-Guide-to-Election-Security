Glossary
========

NIST's Computer Security Resource Center `Glossary <https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/>`_ is a useful reference for information security terms, acronyms, and organizations.

.. glossary::

   authentication
     Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system

   CDM
     Community Defense Model

     Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation

     Continuous Diagnostics and Monitoring

   CIS Controls
     A prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks

   common vulnerabilities and exploits
     The generic name for known cybersecurity vulnerabilities that have been catalogued by the `CVE program <https://www.cve.org>`_. There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog. 
   
   disinformation
     Information deliberately created to mislead, harm, or manipulate a person, social group, organization, or country

   domain name system
     The system by which Internet domain names and addresses are tracked and regulated as defined by IETF RFC 1034 and other related RFCs.

   encryption
     Any procedure used in cryptography to convert plain text into cipher text to prevent anyone but the intended recipient from reading that data

   Endpoint Detection and Response
     Security software that is deployed on workstations and servers, to collect technical data and analyze it for suspicious patterns and threats.

   Endpoint Protection
     Safeguards implemented through software to protect end-user machines such as workstations and laptops against attack (e.g., antivirus, antispyware, anti-adware, personal firewalls, host-based intrusion detection and prevention systems, etc.)

   hashing
     The process of using a mathematical algorithm against data to produce a numeric value that is representative of that data

   Implementation Group
     The recommended guidance to prioritize implementation of the CIS Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls). They are based on the risk profile and resources an enterprise has available to them to implement the CIS Controls.

   malinformation
     Information based on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate

   malicious domain blocking and reporting
     Technology that prevents :term:`IT` systems from connecting to harmful web domains, helping limit infections related to known malware, ransomware, phishing, and other cyber threats

   malware
     Malware is malicious software or software designed to perform malicious actions on a device. It can be introduced to a system in various forms, such as emails or malicious websites.

   misinformation
     Information that is false but not created or shared with the intention of causing harm

   multi-factor authentication
     An authentication system that requires more than one distinct authentication factor for successful authentication. Multi-factor authentication can be performed using a multi-factor authenticator or by a combination of authenticators that provide different factors. The three authentication factors are something you know, something you have, and something you are.

   patching
     The act of applying a change to installed software – such as firmware, operating systems, or applications – that corrects security or functionality problems or adds new capabilities

   ransomware
     A type of malware that blocks access to a system, device, or file until a ransom is paid
  
   salting
     A non-secret value used in a cryptographic process, usually to ensure that the results of computations for one instance cannot be reused by an attacker 

   virtual private network
     Protected information system link utilizing tunneling, security controls, and endpoint address translation giving the impression of a dedicated line

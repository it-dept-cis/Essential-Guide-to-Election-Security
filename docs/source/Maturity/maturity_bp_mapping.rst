A Little Encouragement Before You Start
***************************************

Many elections officials may not consider themselves security or IT professionals. This Guide takes this into consideration. In addition to implementing the best practices for your maturity level, we encourage you to read through the entire Guide. It can provide you an understanding of the types of actions you may want to take as you continually improve your cybersecurity posture. 

Regardless of your current expertise level in this area, there is always capacity for growth, both in our own abilities and in the support of peers and colleagues. If you find yourself not understanding something, be empowered to reach out to the CIS elections, the CIS elections team, and trusted partners and peers at the Federal, State and Local levels for guidance and support.

Maturity Alignment to Best Practices
----------------------------------------------

Not everyone needs to implement every best practice, and most best practices have guidance tailored for each maturity.

This section provides some baseline goals and for each maturity and maps these to best practices. Each best practice is placed in one of three groups, and we recommend you implement based on those groupings, but adjust as makes sense for your organization.

|Maturity1| Maturity
***************************************

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity level, your first goal should be to commit to incrementally improving your maturity. This is about setting simple goals: complete one simple task a week, implement one best practice a month, set aside a minimum set of resources dedicated to cybersecurity every quarter.

Often the most important thing is to establish a priority for the tasks you want to complete so that you know exactly what to do the next time you have (or manage to create) a little time to focus on cybersecurity.

To help with that priority, we recommend the CIS Small Business Guide. It provides a very straightforward set of exercises to help you slowly build maturity in cybersecurity. 


|Maturity1| Maturity Baseline Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(Convert these to links to BPs when available)

1.  Complete inventory worksheets
  a.  Enterprise asset inventory
  #.  Software asset inventory
  #.  Service provider inventory
  #.  Account inventory
  #.  Data inventory
#.  Complete asset protection worksheet for each asset in the inventory
#.  Complete authentication worksheet for each account in the account inventory
#.  Complete backup worksheet for each asset
#.  Fill out incident response worksheet
#.  All employees view the trainings listed in the education worksheet

While the amount of effort can vary greatly depending on the size of your office and number of assets (computers, software, etc.), each exercise is built to take no more than four hours the first time around and as little as 15 minutes each subsequent time.

|Maturity1| Maturity Election Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the above, you should be implementing some measures of particular importance to the election community:

1.  Join the EI-ISAC
#.  Become a member of the EI-ISAC’s Peer Support Tool so you can ask questions and find practical guidance from election officials facing the same concerns as you
#.  Put your website on a .gov domain through the dotgov.gov for elections program
#.  Implement an endpoint protection program through a commercial provider or for free through the EI-ISAC
#.  Implement the malicious domain blocking and reporting tool for free through the EI-ISAC
#.  A removable media sanitization program
#.  Basic incident response and recovery programs

|Maturity1| Maturity Leveling Up Goals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Over time, you’ll want to work your way up to a higher maturity. The following are a prioritized list of recommended actions, but because the threat environment can change, your priorities can change, too. Use information from EI-ISAC membership, colleagues, and other sources to determine if the items here are best for you at the time you’re ready to implement them.

Maturity Alignment to Best Practices
----------------------------------------------

Not everyone needs to implement every best practice, and most best practices have guidance tailored for each maturity.

This section provides some baseline goals for each maturity and maps these to best practices. Each best practice is placed in one of three groups. We recommend you implement based on those groupings, but adjust as it makes sense for your organization.

|Maturity1| Maturity
***************************************

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, your first goal should be to commit to incrementally improving your maturity. This is about setting simple goals: complete one simple task a week, implement one best practice a month, and set aside a minimum set of resources dedicated to cybersecurity every quarter.

Often the most important thing is to establish a priority for the tasks you want to complete so that you know exactly what to do the next time you have (or manage to create) a little time to focus on cybersecurity.

To help with that priority, we recommend CIS's `Small Business Guide <https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-controls-sme-guide>`_. It provides a very straightforward set of exercises to help you slowly build maturity in cybersecurity.


|Maturity1| Maturity Baseline Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is the list of priority actions at the |Maturity1| maturity. If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, we recommend starting with these to establish a baseline of cyber hygiene.

**Actions**

1.  Complete the six simple :doc:`IT inventory worksheets <../appendices/worksheets.rst#IT-Inventory-Worksheets>`_. Together, these fulfill the `Asset Management <../BPs/asset_management>`_ best practice for |Maturity1|.
2.  Complete the asset protection worksheet for each asset in the inventory.
  encrypt_data_at_rest
  managing_workstations
3.  Complete authentication worksheet for each account in the account inventory.
  user_management -- user inventory worksheet
4.  Complete backup worksheet for each asset.
  backups
5.  Fill out the incident response worksheet.
  incident_management [coming in phase2]
6.  All employees view the trainings listed in the education worksheet.
  managing_staff (training)

While the needed effort can vary greatly depending on the size of your office and number of assets (computers, software, etc.), each exercise is built to take no more than four hours the first time around and as little as 15 minutes each subsequent time.

|Maturity1| Maturity Election Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the above, you should be implementing some measures of particular importance to the election community:

1.  Join the :doc:`EI-ISAC <BPs/join_ei_isac>`.
..  #.  Become a member of the EI-ISACâ€™s Peer Support Tool so you can ask questions and find practical guidance from election officials facing the same concerns as you.
#.  Put your website on a .gov domain through the _`dotgov.gov <https://dotgov.gov>` program.
#.  Implement an :doc:`endpoint protection <BPs/endpoint_protection>` program through a commercial provider or for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Implement the :doc:`malicious domain blocking and reporting <BPs/mdbr>` tool for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  A :doc:`removable media sanitization program <BPs/removable_media>.
#.  Establish a baseline incident response and recovery program.

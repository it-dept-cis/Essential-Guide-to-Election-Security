Maturities
---------------------------------

The Purpose of Maturity Levels
*********************************

Not all election offices have the same experience, resources, or needs. States and territories vary from a few thousand residents to tens of millions, counties and municipalities from a few dozen residents to more than 10 million. The differences in populations served result in widely varying tax bases, staffing levels, number and type of IT and physical assets, and more. Correspondingly, different election offices will implement different best practices at different times.

While an election office should implement best practices in a manner best fit for its needs, establishing maturity levels provides some rough contours around these differences. By defining a few different maturity levels, CIS can provide a starting point that any given office can implement or use to tailor its approach.

Maturity Levels in the Essential Guide
********************************************

This section will help election officials determine their current maturity level. There are three levels defined in this handbook to reflect an organization’s capabilities in managing cybersecurity risk. The maturities are derived from the three CIS Controls Implementation Groups, with important differences based on the nature of and risks associated with election administration. The Implementation Groups are determined based on three attributes:
1.	Data sensitivity and criticality of services offered by the organization
2.	Expected level of technical expertise exhibited by staff or on contract
3.	Resources available and dedicated toward cybersecurity activities
Because this handbook’s audience is those operating in the election environment, we have a rough estimate of the first attribute: election infrastructure is critical infrastructure, and the organization deals with sensitive data related to the elections it administers.
Many election offices have a misalignment between the level of criticality of their services and the resources available to dedicate toward cybersecurity. To address this, this handbook focuses on meeting election offices where they are and helping to incrementally raise them to higher levels of maturity.
Later in the handbook we use these maturity levels to provide specific recommendations for managing cybersecurity risk and, ultimately, leveling up an organization’s maturity. The three maturity levels are:
1.	Reactive: The organization responds to threats when presented to them or when attacked but has little capacity to predict, foresee, or model attacks
2.	Preventative: The organization focuses on deploying tools to stay ahead of threats and attempts to implement lessons learned but staff and contractors are not or have limited specialization in cybersecurity
3.	Adaptive: The organization assesses its risk and employs experts in the different facets of cybersecurity—e.g., risk management, penetration testing, application security

Maturities in this Essential Guide
********************************************

The next page will provide questions that can help guide you to one of the three maturities.

You don't have to choose these precisely, but without other information, implementing the priority actions for the maturity that best describes your oganization can give you a quick route to improving your cybersecurity posture.

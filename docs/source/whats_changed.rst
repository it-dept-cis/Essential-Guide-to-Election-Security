What's Changed
-------------------------

Election offices operate in an environment heavy on information technology (:term:`IT`). The teams administering elections have been protecting these environments for decades. Still, as the threats evolve and the measures for mitigating IT risk increase in complexity, their task becomes ever more difficult.

In early 2018, the Center for Internet Security (:term:`CIS`), with significant contributions from the election community, published its Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security, a guide to assist election offices in defending their IT systems from cybersecurity threat actors. It consisted of 88 best practices to mitigate risk across all types of election equipment.

CIS received positive feedback from the election community on the value of the tool. In the four years since then, several important changes have occurred:


1.	The CIS Controls, on which many of the 88 best practices are based, have undergone a major revision, creating a need to, at minimum, update the language in the handbook.
#.	The Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (:term:`EI-ISAC`) has greatly increased the set of freely available tools and services for election offices across the country.
#.	Since releasing the handbook, CIS has developed a series of best practice guides and other information [link]. Other organizations have also contributed to the body of knowledge for security election infrastructure and related activities, including:
  *	A wide array of guidance and tools available from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and other government agencies; and
  *	A body of work for other academic and nonprofit organizations such as Harvard University’s Belfer Center, the Brennan Center for Justice, and others.
#.	Election officials have made great, but often unequal, strides in meeting today’s threats. This has created an even wider array of “have” and “have-nots” with resultant differences in cybersecurity postures.
#.	The nature of threats have changed: in 2016, national state actors posed most of the apparent risks. Today we have more information on real world attacks and know that they come from a variety of sources and are both kinetic and non-kinetic.
#.	Mis-, dis-, and mal-information (:term:`MDMinfo`) has grown to be one of the thorniest and most pervasive threats to democracy and election officials need guidance on mitigating misinformation threats. This includes many types of MDMinfo, including about the administration of a specific election, issue- and candidate-based, and delegitimization of election results.


How is this version different?
-----------------------------------

These changes to the election ecosystem warrant a rethinking of the original handbook. Developed in collaboration with federal partners, state and local election officials, and election technology providers, this update takes several major steps to address this continual evolution of the election space:

1.	We’ve developed a more rigorous maturity model. In the original handbook, we simply listed high, medium and low priorities to each of the 88 best practices. This roughly said what in what order to do things, but didn't take into account a given jurisdiction's resources or capabilities. Now, we have three maturity levels and a decision tree for finding an organization’s fit. For any best practice, the approach implementation takes into consideration whether, for instance, having limited technical expertise versus having well-trained teams of IT security specialists. These are described in detail in the :doc:`maturities` section.
#.  We've incorporated new best practices that cover the many threats and opportunities--like MDMinfo and free services--that have emerged, and with the new format we'll continue to add and evolve guidance as necessary.
#.	We’ve added a substantial listing of available resources and additional direction embedded within the handbook for when a given resource is appropriate.
#.	We've moved from the original Handbook--a static paper or PDF document--to a more dynamic web-based experience. As described :doc:`earlier <README#Why-does-this-Guide-look-like-a-webpage?>`, this allows continually updated online tools, videos, and resources as threats evolve and new opportunities emerge.
#.	We’re developing a “peer support” tool to enable election teams to communicate with each other, creatively solve problems, share best practices, and rapidly and collaboratively respond to emerging issues.

In addition to these, there are many minor updates we hope improve the usability of this handbook, allowing it to serve as an effective tool for every election office regardless of size, resources, or technical sophistication.

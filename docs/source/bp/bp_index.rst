Index of Best Practices
-----------------------------------------------

The following table lists the best practices and indicated if they have actions associated with them for each maturity level and if they are a priority action ("Priority") for each maturity level. 

* "In Scope" means you should complete that best practice.
* "Out of Scope" means the best practice doesn't apply to you.
* "Priority" means you should focus on that best practice before other in scope best practices.

For more details on maturities in this Guide, see the :doc:`maturities descriptions <../maturity/maturities>`. 

To learn how to determine the maturity at which your organization operates, see the :doc:`maturity determination <../maturity/determine_maturity>` guide. 

CIS's Community Defense Model drives the ordering of these best practices. We encourage you to follow this order, but every organization is different, so make adjustments as necessary.

For a better understanding of how these priorities were determined and for a better understanding of how to start implementing these best practices, see the maturity to best practice :doc:`mapping <../maturity/maturity_bp_mapping>`.

You can use this table as a checklist to help track your progress.

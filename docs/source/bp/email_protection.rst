----------------------------------------------

The top cybersecurity threat to your organization is sitting in your employeesâ€™ inboxes. For all its limitations, email remains a very common mode of communication in the business environment. Email has long been a favored attack vector for cyber threat actors, using it for a wide variety of attacks, including malware and ransomware, phishing, spam, and email spoofing. According to the 2022 `Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report <https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/>`_, 82% of breaches in the previous year involved the human element -- whether stolen credentials, phishing, misuse, or simple human errors.

Using email requires training and vigilance. It is a direct connection to users, which are often the weakest aspect of cybersecurity defenses. 

There are many email security trainings for end users; it's important to use one that engages and informs. It should cover:

* Basic email security
* Identifying phishing and other suspicious emails
* Social engineering
* Authentication (i.e., MFA and passphrases)
* Handling personal information and sensitive data

Deploy multi-factor authentication (MFA) on email, along with passphrases. In addition, IT administators can improve outcomes by using email protection services, which typcally enable:

* Inbound mail screening, 
* Malware and ransomware protection, 
* Phishing protection, 
* Spam filtering, 
* Email spoofing protection, 
* Traffic blocking, 
* Allowlisting of false positives, and 
* Denylisting of false negatives.

Email protection solutions vary widely in costs and complexity, so it's important to select a solution that will work well with your jurisdiction's capabilities and resources. Generally, they work as detailed in the figure below.

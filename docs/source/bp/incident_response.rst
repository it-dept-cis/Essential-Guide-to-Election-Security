|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

From power failures to flooding to malicous cyber attacks, incidents occur. While the type of incident and sophistication of the threat actors plays a major role in the outcomes, often the difference between minor and severe consequences have more to do with how you prepare for and respond to the incident. 

To get back up and running quickly after an incident, you have to plan well. This means developing written plans -- often called incident response plans, disaster recovery plans, or business continuity plans. It also means testing those plans through exercises.

Goals

#. Develop and maintain an incident response plan (|Maturity1| maturity)
#. Exercise your plans (|Maturity1| maturity)

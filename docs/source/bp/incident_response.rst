|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

Incidents can take all shapes. From power failures to flooding to malicous cyber attacks, incidents occur. While the type of incident and sophistication of the threat actors plays a major role in the outcomes, often the difference between minor and severe consequences have more to do with how you prepare for and respond to the incident. 

A good response to an incident gets you back up and running more quickly. To respond well to an incident, you have to plan well. This means developing written plans--often call incident response plans, disaster recovery plans, or business continuity plans. It also means testing those plans through exercises.

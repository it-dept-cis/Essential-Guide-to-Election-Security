|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------
Internal penetration testing can provide valuable and objective insights about the existence of vulnerabilities in enterprise assets and humans, and the efficacy of defenses and mitigating controls to protect against adverse impacts to the enterprise. They are part of a comprehensive, ongoing program of security management and improvement. They can also reveal process weaknesses, such as incomplete or inconsistent configuration management, or end-user training.

Penetration tests are expensive, complex, and potentially introduce their own risks. Experienced individuals from reputable organizations must conduct them. Accordingly, it is rare that this expertise already exists within an election office. Some risks include unexpected shutdown of systems that might be unstable, exploits that might delete or corrupt data or configurations, and the output of a testing report that needs to be protected itself, because it gives step-by-step instructions on how to break into the enterprise to target critical assets or data.

Goals
**********************************************

#. Conduct a penetration test of internal jurisdiction assets with capable and trustworthy organizations (|Maturity3| maturity) 
#. Understand and correct findings of the results report in a timely manner (|Maturity3| maturity)

#. Identify high and low-value election assets requiring internal penetration testing. 
#. Identify a suitable organization for performing the testing. These resources may be available via a state agency, university, or third-party company. Note that it is rare that this expertise already exists within an election organization.

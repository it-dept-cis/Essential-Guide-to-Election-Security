.. _Addressing Physical Threats

|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

Sadly, in the last several years, election officials have been subjected to increased threats, harassment, and doxing, causing a significant negative impact on their personal lives as well as interfering with the secure operation of our government processes and election infrastructure.

Officials are used to receiving emails and voicemails that criticize their work. However, attempts to threaten or intimidate are unacceptable, and officials should report any such behavior immediately. Doxing is also unacceptable. This is the publishing of an individual's personal information online which can increase the risk of physical threats and intimidation. 

There are resources available to help and support you and your team and to give guidance on proactive steps you can take. Several of these are listed below. **If you feel there is any chance of an immediate risk to you or others, do not wait, call 911.**

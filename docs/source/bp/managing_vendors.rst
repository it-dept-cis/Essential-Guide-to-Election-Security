----------------------------------------------

In nearly all election jurisdictions, many of the hardware, software, and services that underpin our elections—from voter registration and election management systems to pollbooks and vote capture devices—are procured from private vendors.

Even simple public-facing websites may be procured and their security—or lack thereof—may have consequences on elections. The industry partners from which :term:`IT` is procured play a critical role in managing the security risks inherent in elections.

Understanding and properly managing security expectations in the procurement process can have a substantial impact on the success of the election process.

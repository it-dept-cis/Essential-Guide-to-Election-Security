|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------
Often, penetration tests are performed for specific purposes:

* As a “dramatic” demonstration of an attack, usually to convince decision-makers of their enterprise’s weaknesses
* As a means to test the correct operation of enterprise defenses (“verification”)
* To test that the enterprise has built the right defenses in the first place (“validation”)

This best practice looks to address what occurs once the penetration testing has been completed. The organization performing the penetration test will provide a written report of their results. It is becoming increasingly popular to conduct penetration tests through third-party legal counsel to protect the penetration test report from disclosure. 
Once a report is received, the security team and other affected parts of the organization need to review the report to understand the findings. The organization performing the test is often available for questions to clarify issues documented in the report. 

This is a test. 

Goals
**********************************************

#. Work to understand the results report from the penetration test. Create a plan to remediate findings in a logical manner, according to the severity of the findings. 

|Maturity1| and |Maturity2| Maturities
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

There are no actions for |Maturity1| and |Maturity2|. 

|Maturity3| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

#. Review and understand the results of the penetration testing report with all IT and security staff that have responsibilities. 
#. Ask questions of the organization that performed the penetration test to clarify any misunderstandings or concerns that may require an update to the report. 
#. Create a list of items to fix. 
#. Prioritize this list based on severity. 
#. Assign list items to appropriate personnel.

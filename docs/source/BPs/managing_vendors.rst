----------------------------------------------

In nearly all election jurisdictions, many of the hardware, software, and services that underpin our elections—-from voter registration and election management systems to pollbooks and vote capture devices—-are procured from private vendors. Even simple public-facing websites may be procured and their security—or lack thereof—may have consequences on elections. The industry partners from which information technology (IT) is procured play a critical role in managing the security risks inherent in elections.

Understanding and properly managing security expectations in the procurement process can have a substantial impact on the success of the election process.

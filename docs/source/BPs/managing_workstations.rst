*Status: draft*

*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

Workstation management involves configuring systems to reduce the risk of cyber attacks. Most workstations (e.g., desktop, laptops, tablets) should have capabilities limited to the job function they serve. Often, this is tied to the type of employee to which the workstation is issued. Other times, it's about the use the workstation plays in the office.

Configurations can be done manually or with automated tools.

Goals
**********************************************

#.  Understand the value of restricting workstation permissions.
#.  Know where to find configuration guidance for various workstations.

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions vary by maturity as detailed below.

|Maturity1| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

**Actions**

#. Limit administrative access to machines that perform administrative functions.

|Maturity2| and |Maturity3| Maturities
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

#. Leverage the a CIS _`Benchmark <https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/>` on workstation management for your operating systems.
  * Choose stricter security levels for systems with sensitive functions.
  * Consider benchmarks for desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and software on systems.
  * Use the :term:`EMS` Gateway Benchmark for machines that, through removable media, exchange data with the EMS.

*Status: draft*

|bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

The CIS _`Critical Security Controls™ <https://www.cisecurity.org/controls>` are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks.

The CIS Controls are developed by a consensus-based community of cybersecurity experts who apply their first-hand experience as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices.

Within each of the 18 CIS Controls is a set of safeguards focused on a specific security function. There are a total of 153 safeguards.

The CIS Controls are internationally recognized for bringing together expert insight about threats, business technology, and defensive options into an effective, coherent, and simpler way to manage an organization’s security improvement program. Yet experience has shown that organizations of every size and complexity still need more help to get started, and to focus their attention and resources. The CIS Implementation Groups (IGs) were created to address this need. These Implementation Groups provide a simple and accessible way to help organizations of different classes focus their scarce security resources, and still leverage the value of the CIS Controls program, community, and complementary tools and working aids. The CIS Controls are organized into three Implementation Groups, each with its own unique list of Safeguards from the CIS Controls. The maturities in this Guide are loosely based on those IG classifications:
* Basic – Contains controls that help an organization assess its current security and take simple steps to improve it. This is broadly equivalent to CIS IG1.
* Foundational – Contains more advanced guidance to improve an organization’s security. This is broadly equivalent to CIS IG2.
* Organizational – Contains controls that make changes to an organization’s policies to improve and maintain their cybersecurity. This is broadly equivalent to CIS IG3.

----------------------------------------------

The CIS _`Critical Security Controls™ <https://www.cisecurity.org/controls>` are a prioritized set of actions that collectively form a defense-in-depth set of best practices that mitigate the most common attacks against systems and networks.

The CIS Controls are developed by a consensus-based community of cybersecurity experts who apply their first-hand experience as cyber defenders to create these globally accepted security best practices.

Within each of the 18 CIS Controls is a set of safeguards focused on a specific security function. There are a total of **XXX** safeguards.

The CIS Controls are organized into three Implementation Groups (IGs). The maturities in this guide are loosely based on those IGs:
* Basic – Contains controls that help an organization assess its current security and take simple steps to improve it.
* Foundational – Contains more advanced guidance to improve an organization’s security.
* Organizational – Contains controls that make changes to an organization’s policies to improve and maintain their cybersecurity.

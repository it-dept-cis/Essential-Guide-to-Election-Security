*Status: draft*

*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

While removable media such as USB drives and PCMCIA cards are going extinct in most IT environments, they are still an important tool where not some machines are network connected.

In the election environment the election management system and voting systems typically have no network connections and are not on the internet, so removable media remains an part of everyday life.

While keeping hardware and software off of networks can eliminate certain threats, others can be introduced by exchanging data with removable media, so election offices need to be sure to properly source and sanitize anything used to physically transfer data between machines.

Actions
**********************************************

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions vary by maturity as detailed below.

|Maturity1| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

It's best to use removable media only once. This could mean using a CD-R, DVD-R, or other once-write media, but that can be difficult with today's machines.

Instead, use USB sticks or other removable media like flash cards. If your budget can sustain it, use them once. If not, follow a media sanitization guide for

Also, be sure to source your removable media from trusted sources or, if you can't, the consumer market, like a big box store where there's enough volume that it would be difficult to target you as an election office. CIS's |cybermarket| offers USB sticks and other products from vetted vendors.

|Maturity2| and |Maturity3| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

While following the same guidance as the |Maturity1| maturity, make removable media sanitization a part of your larger media sanitization program. |NIST800-88| is the gold standard for such a program.

----------------------------------------------

Wireless networks are a critical piece of modern connectivity. In the election environment, some systems, like voting machines, are never connected to a wireless network. Others, like e-pollbooks, often have to be to on a wireless network to properly update voter rolls.

There's also the day-to-day administration of the elections that occur on regular workstations. These may use wired or wireless connections and have access to private networks or the internet.

Good cybersecurity outcomes require proper management of the wireless networks and connections in your offices and polling places.

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions are the same for all maturity levels.

**Actions**

#. Change administrator passwords on routers and other wireless access points to a secure passphrase.
#. Change the default access passphrase for wireless networks regularly, or enable user level authentication for private networks.
#. Don't permit visitors to use your primary wireless network. Instead set up a separate network or enable a guest network.
#. Carefully decide whether a new device will be allowed on the network; you don't need to permit every new device onto the network.
#. Keep firmware and software up to date by including your router and other access points in your :doc:`patching` schedule.
#. Use :doc:`encryption` for all network traffic.
#. Track what's on your network.

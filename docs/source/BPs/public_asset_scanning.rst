.. |bp_title| replace:: Publicly-Facing Network Scanning

*Status: draft*

*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

All code needs to be tested for flaws, and given the types of attacks that work on a given type of code change as adversaries develop new techniques, deployed code needs to be tested regularly for known vulnerabilities.

For public-facing assets, various types of scanning can find known vulnerabilities and provide reports that prioritize them based on standardized severities. These scanning tools are automated and can run regularly to always keep you informed of your progress and any new issues due to changes you make or the evolving threat environment.

Common types of scanning or network testing include:

* Vulnerability Scanning: Reviews public-facing websites for vulnerabilities
* Web application scanning: Reviews public-facing applications for vulnerabilities
* Remote penetration testing: A more advanced method of using known tactics to simulate attacks and find more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities

Goals
**********************************************

#.	Understand the types of scanning and how they can help protect publicly-facing assets
#.	Know how to access free, automated services for scanning publicly-facing assets

Mappings to CIS Controls and Safeguards

Actions
**********************************************

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions vary by maturity as detailed below.

|Maturity1| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

At the |Maturity1| maturity, you should be using free tools to conduct scanning of your publicly-facing assets.

CISA offers all of its cybersecurity assessment services at no cost to election offices.

* Sign up for free vulnerability scanning by contacting CISA at |CISA_vuln_email| with subject line "Requesting Cyber Hygiene Services."
* If you have web applications, sign up for free web application scanning at |CISA_vuln_email| with subject line "Requesting Cyber Hygiene Services."

|Maturity2| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

At the |Maturity2| maturity, you should also implement remote penetration testing.

* Sign up for free remote penetration testing by contacting CISA at |CISA_vuln_email| with subject line "Requesting Cyber Hygiene Services."

|Maturity3| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

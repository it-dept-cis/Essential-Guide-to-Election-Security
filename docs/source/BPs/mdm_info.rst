.. |bp_title| replace:: Managing Mis-, Dis-, and Malinformation

*Status: draft*

*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

Mis-, dis-, and mal-information have become a pervasive threat to the election environment. Each has a specific definition. Together, we call them MDM for MDMinfo.

* Misinformation is false, but not created or shared with the intention of causing harm.
* Disinformation is deliberately created to mislead, harm, or manipulate a person, social group, organization, or country.
* Malinformation is based on fact, but used out of context to mislead, harm, or manipulate.

MDM info campaigns are engineered for influence, typically seeking to exploit the psychology of victims’ emotions, identities, political affinities, and existing societal rifts.

Both independent threat actors and large nation-state operations are capable of manufacturing MDMinfo. Threat actors may have hundreds of human attackers on payroll, or choose to conduct operations via automated bots. When users encounter inaccurate information or intentional disinformation they may be unable to differentiate it from genuine information, sharing it and unwittingly influencing an even wider audience as misinformation.

Influencing the political environment through social discourse is a tactic observed in well-funded and complex information attacks, but actors may have competitive, financial or other motivations as well. Disinformation attacks can function by creating continued influence in a system or sector. Attackers may try to popularize perspectives and viewpoints in target demographics that lead to certain policy or political outcomes. Appearing as authentic citizens or a real customer-base on social media, individual disinformation accounts can appeal to users and align with their existing sentiment. Organizations and individuals alike then experience the pressure to act on what is perceived as recurring legitimate messaging but, in reality, is deception.

Goals
**********************************************

#.      Recognize MDMinfo and its potential impact on election administration
#.      Know what to do when you encounter MDMinfo

Mappings to CIS Controls and Safeguards
**********************************************

There are no relevant CIS Controls.

Actions
**********************************************

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions vary by maturity as detailed below.

|Maturity1| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

At the |Maturity1| maturity, simple steps can help you manage MDMinfo and address it when it occurs.

#      Set up multi-factor authentication to protect social media accounts from compromise.
# Use public forums to actively counter disinformation and misinformation.
# Regularly publish official messaging about the state of your election infrastructure, responding with accurate information as quickly as possible. This rapid response is even more important as an election nears.
#      Work with local media to promote official sources of information.
Remediating Disinformation and Misinformation

When you see MDMinfo, report it.

#      Election officials can report identified disinformation and misinformation to misinformation@cisecurity.org. Include the following information: **Are we publishing this email address in this way now? It is in the spotlight and CISA has put it out**
  -      **update with new 1-pager language**
  - A screenshot of the social media post and, if possible, the URL
  - Your name, role, jurisdiction, and official email address
  - A description of why this is misinformation. This doesn’t have to be more than a couple sentences, but more detail is better. Citing a law is even better.
  - EI-ISAC will share this information with its partners and work to have the misinformation removed from the platform(s) you report.


|Maturity2| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

At the |Maturity2| maturity level, you should take the actions above as well as some additional steps to protect against impacts from MDMinfo.

# The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) offers an end user guide and additional resources to spot and manage responses to disinformation:
  -      Recognize the risk of foreign actor operations.
  - Question the source of content and question intent.
  - Investigate the issue for other reliable sources before sharing.
  - Think before you share, disinformation is designed to evoke an emotional response.
  - Talk with your circle about the risks of spreading disinformation.
# Review the Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center publication, “The Election Influence Operations Playbook” for a deeper understanding of these issues and response guidance.
#      Establish a mechanism for the public to report disinformation and misinformation to your office, such as an email or phone number (e.g.disinfo@example.gov).

|Maturity3| Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

At the |Maturity3| maturity, consider having focused work stream to identify and remediate MDMinfo. This can include things like:

# Keeping track of hashtags, keywords, and other trends on various social media platforms.
# Following activity related to your election across a number of platforms, to include smaller, niche apps.
# Contracting with a third party to provide these services for you.
# If a state, providing services for your locals.

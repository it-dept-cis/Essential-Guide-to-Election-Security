First Steps: Prioritizing Best Practices
----------------------------------------

No one wants to suffer a cybersecurity incident. The intent to protect networks is universal, but resource limitations leave many organizations facing perhaps the most difficult question in all of cybersecurity: What do I do next?

This section prioritizes best practices by mapping each maturity level to the priority best practices that should be implemented by an election office at that maturity level.

.. _maturity-mapping-to-bp-maturity-one-description:

|Maturity1| Maturity
********************

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, your first goal should be to commit to incrementally improving your maturity. This is about setting simple goals. For example, complete one simple task a week, implement one best practice a month, and set aside a minimum set of resources dedicated to cybersecurity every quarter. Whatever helps you make progress.

.. _maturity-one-maturity-baseline-priorities:

|Maturity1| Maturity Baseline Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is the list of priority actions at the |Maturity1| maturity. If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, we recommend starting with these to establish a baseline of cyber hygiene.

**Actions**

1. Download and complete the :doc:`worksheets <../appendices/worksheets>` for |Maturity1| maturity baseline. There are ten worksheets, all in one downloadable file.

   * Together, these fulfill all of the |Maturity1| baseline priorities. In the table below, the left column is the name of a |Maturity1| maturity worksheet described :doc:`here <../appendices/worksheets>`. On that page you can download one file with all ten worksheets. The middle column gives the relevant best practice in this Guide for the worksheet tab, and the right columns lists the actions within that best practice that are fulfilled by completing the worksheet tab. 

+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Worksheet                    | Best Practice (Actions from the Best Practice Adressed by the Worksheet)                       |
+==============================+================================================================================================+
| * Hardware Inventory         |                                                                                                |
| * Software Inventory         |                                                                                                |
| * Data Inventory             | :ref:`Asset Management <asset-management-maturity-one>` (Action #1)                            |
| * Service Provider Inventory |                                                                                                |
| * Account Inventory          |                                                                                                |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Asset Protection             | * :ref:`Encrypt Data At Rest <encrypt-data-at-rest-maturity-one>` (All Actions)                |
|                              | * :ref:`Managing Infrastructure <managing-infrastructure-maturity-one>` (Actions #1 and #2)    |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Account Security             | :ref:`User Management <user-management-maturity-one>` (All Actions under User Recommendations) |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Backup & Recovery            | :ref:`Backups <backups-maturity-one>`  (Action #1)                                             |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Incident Response            | :ref:`Incident Response <incident-response-maturity-one>`  (Actions #1 and #4)                 |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Cyber Education              | :ref:`Building and Managing Staff <managing-staff-maturity-one>`  (Actions #2 and #3)          |
+------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

While the needed effort can vary greatly depending on the size of your office and number of assets (computers, software, etc.), each :doc:`worksheet <../appendices/worksheets>` is built to take no more than four hours the first time around and as little as 15 minutes each subsequent time. A suggestion: set aside time to do one a week until you've got them all done; then they're easy to repeat.

.. _maturity-one-maturity-election-priorities:

|Maturity1| Maturity Election Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the above, you should be implementing some measures of particular importance to the election community:

1.  Join the :doc:`EI-ISAC <../bp/join_ei_isac>`.
#.  :doc:`Protect your website <../bp/websites>` with simple and free tools.
#.  Implement an :doc:`endpoint protection <../bp/endpoint_protection>` program through a commercial provider or for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Implement the :doc:`malicious domain blocking and reporting <../bp/mdbr>` tool for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Manage your :doc:`removable media <../bp/removable_media>`.

..
    #. Become a member of the `EI-ISACâ€™s Peer Support Tool <url>`_ so you can ask questions and find practical guidance from election officials facing the same concerns as you.

More mature organizations should take a more sophisticated approach to prioritizing best practice implementation.

The CIS Community Defense Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To help organizations determine where to invest their next dollar in cybersecurity, CIS developed the :term:`Community Defense Model` (CDM). The `CDM <https://www.cisecurity.org/insights/white-papers/cis-community-defense-model-2-0>`_ was created to help answer that and other questions about the value of the :term:`CIS Controls` based on currently available threat data from industry reports. Ready more about the CIS Controls in the CIS Controls :doc:`best practice <../bp/cis_controls>`.

Using authoritative data sources like the Verizon `Data Breach Investigations Report <https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/>`_, CIS identified the top attack types that enterprises should defend against. 

For CDM 2.0, the top five attack types are:

#. Malware
#. Ransomware
#. Web Application Hacking
#. Insider and Privilege Misuse
#. Targeted Intrusions 

Certain techniques are used to execute each of these types of attacks. The CDM uses the `MITRE ATT&CK framework <http://attack.mitre.org>`_ to cateogize these techniques and sub-techniques. These are mapped to mitigations, such as the Safeguards contained with the CIS Controls and the actions within this Guide's best practices, that protect against one or more sub-technique.

Using real world data, the CDM determines which Safeguards are the most efficient--the Safeguards that mitigate the most sub-techniques and thus, when implemented, are most likely to stop any given attack. 

In the table below, we map the highest efficiency Safeguards from the CIS Controls to the best practices in this Guide to establish the priority best practices. For more details on the efficiency rankings, see Figure 13 of the CDM 2.0.

This efficiency ranking drives the ordering of the best practices in this Guide, with some exceptions particular to elections. While we recommend following the prescribed order, do what's best for your environment and, most importantly, keep making progress!

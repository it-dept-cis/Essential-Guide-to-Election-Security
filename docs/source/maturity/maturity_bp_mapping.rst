  to: provide a map from maturities to best practices. this is a shortcut for all maturities. individual pointers should exist in each maturity and this is a summary of them

Maturity Alignment to Best Practices
----------------------------------------------

This section provides baseline goals for each maturity and maps these to best practices. Each best practice is placed in one of three groups. We recommend you implement based on those groupings, but adjust as it makes sense for your organization.

|Maturity1| Maturity
***************************************

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, your first goal should be to commit to incrementally improving your maturity. This is about setting simple goals: complete one simple task a week, implement one best practice a month, and set aside a minimum set of resources dedicated to cybersecurity every quarter. Whatever helps you make progress.

.. _maturity-one-maturity-baseline-priorities:

|Maturity1| Maturity Baseline Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following is the list of priority actions at the |Maturity1| maturity. If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, we recommend starting with these to establish a baseline of cyber hygiene.

**Actions**

1. Download and complete the :doc:`worksheets <../appendices/worksheets>` for |Maturity1| maturity baseline.

Together, these fulfill all of the |Maturity1| baseline priorities:

While the needed effort can vary greatly depending on the size of your office and number of assets (computers, software, etc.), each exercise is built to take no more than four hours the first time around and as little as 15 minutes each subsequent time. A suggestions: set aside time to do one a week until you've got them all done; then they're easy to repeat.

|Maturity1| Maturity Election Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the above, you should be implementing some measures of particular importance to the election community:

1.  Join the :doc:`EI-ISAC <../bp/join_ei_isac>`.
#.  :doc:`Protect your website <../bp/websites>` with simple and free tools.
#.  Implement an :doc:`endpoint protection <../bp/endpoint_protection>` program through a commercial provider or for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Implement the :doc:`malicious domain blocking and reporting <../bp/mdbr>` tool for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  A :doc:`removable media sanitization program <../bp/removable_media>`.
#.  Establish a baseline incident response and recovery program (best practice coming in phase 2).

..
    #. Become a member of the `EI-ISACâ€™s Peer Support Tool <url>`_ so you can ask questions and find practical guidance from election officials facing the same concerns as you.

Prioritizing Best Practices for the |Maturity1| maturity
--------------------------------------------------------

No one wants to suffer a cybersecurity incident. The intent to protect networks is universal, but resource limitations leave many organizations facing perhaps the most difficult question in all of cybersecurity: What do I do next?

This section prioritizes best practices by mapping each maturity level to the priority best practices that should be implemented by an election office at that maturity level.

|Maturity1| Maturity
********************

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, your first goal should be to commit to incrementally improving your maturity. This is about setting simple goals. For example, complete one simple task a week, implement one best practice a month, and set aside a minimum set of resources dedicated to cybersecurity every quarter. Whatever helps you make progress.

|Maturity1| Maturity Baseline Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are at the |Maturity1| maturity, we recommend starting with these to establish a baseline of cyber hygiene. This is the starting point to building yourself up to a :doc:`defense-in-depth <../bp/defense_in_depth>` posture.

**Actions**

1. Download and complete the :doc:`worksheets <../appendices/worksheets>` for the |Maturity1| maturity baseline. There are ten worksheets, all in one downloadable file.

   * Together, these fulfill **all** of the |Maturity1| baseline priorities. 
   * The left column in the table is the name of a |Maturity1| maturity worksheet described :doc:`here <../appendices/worksheets>`. On that page you can download one file with all ten worksheets. 
   * The right column gives the relevant best practice actions fulfilled by the worksheet(s).

| Worksheet                    | Actions Fullfilled by the Worksheet                                                              |
+==============================+==================================================================================================+
| * Hardware Inventory         |                                                                                                  |
| * Software Inventory         |                                                                                                  |

| * Service Provider Inventory |                                                                                                  |
| * Account Inventory          |                                                                                                  |

|                              | * Actions 1 and 2 of :ref:`Managing Infrastructure <managing-infrastructure-maturity-one>`       |
+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Account Security             | All actions under User Recommendations of :ref:`User Management <user-management-maturity-one>`  |
+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Backup & Recovery            | Action 1 of :ref:`Backups <backups-maturity-one>`                                                |
+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

| Cyber Education              | Actions 2 and 3 of :ref:`Building and Managing Staff <managing-staff-maturity-one>`              |
+------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

While effort for each worksheet can vary greatly depending on the size of your office and number of assets (computers, software, etc.), each :doc:`worksheet <../appendices/worksheets>` is built to take no more than four hours the first time around and as little as 15 minutes each subsequent time. A suggestion: set aside time to do one a week until you've got them all done; then they're easy to repeat.

.. _maturity-one-maturity-election-priorities:

|Maturity1| Maturity Election Priorities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In addition to the above, you should be implementing some measures specific to elections:

1.  Join the :doc:`EI-ISAC <../bp/join_ei_isac>`.
#.  :doc:`Protect your website <../bp/websites>` with simple and free tools.
#.  Implement an :doc:`endpoint protection <../bp/endpoint_protection>` program through a commercial provider or for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Implement the :doc:`malicious domain blocking and reporting <../bp/mdbr>` tool for free through the EI-ISAC.
#.  Manage your :doc:`removable media <../bp/removable_media>`.

If you complete these, you have implemented all of the priority best practices for the |Maturity1| maturity! Keep working on other :doc:`in scope best practices <../bp/bp_index>` and work your way up to the |Maturity2| maturity!

Appendix: About the Essential Guide to Election Security
--------------------------------------------------------

When `The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security <https://www.cisecurity.org/elections>`_ was published in 2018, election officials had much less guidance to rely on. Today, they often have the opposite problem: an enormous amount of guidance to navigate. With so much guidance and so many tools and approaches available, it's difficult for any given election official to know what will best work for them.

This Guide aims to solve that problem and aid the process of building a program designed to meet the individual needs and abilities of any given election office.

Why does this Guide look like a webpage? (Or does it??)
-------------------------------------------------------

You might be reading this online. Or you might be reading a PDF. If the latter, it's because your PDF was built from an online version. Here's why we're keeping all of the content for the Guide online:

CIS published The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security in early 2018, just before the `Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center <bp/join_ei_isac.rst>`_ (EI-ISAC) launch.

In 2021, the EI-ISAC began working with the election community to update that Handbook. A common item of feedback we received was that the static nature of the Handbook meant it didn't include any of new and evolving the best practices that weren't already in place in early 2018.

Creating an updated version of that Handbook would've left us in the same position: the pace of new best practices and services available to secure election infrastructure is too rapid to rely on a static model for communicating them to election officials.

Instead, we decided to create this dynamic, always up-to-date online Guide. It can still be exported as one big PDF, but when you do so, you will get the best practices current as of the moment you hit the button to create the PDF.

We can also embed and link to more engaging content like videos and examples. When best practices change, officials face new risks, or different resources become available, we can quickly update the Guide to reflect the new state of the world.

The Essential Guide to Election Security
==============================================
*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

A security assessment is a thorough, proactive study of an organization’s systems that helps identify security challenges and implement solutions. It is a benefit to election offices as they can use assessments to prevent cyberattacks, meet national standards, and gain voter trust.

Assessments help identify and prevent security issues. They can also justify a budget and guide procurements of security resources, tools, and services.

Formal cybersecurity assessments are a fundamental aspect of managing cybersecurity risk.  Risk assessments can be sorted into two categories:
#. Self-assessments: In-house risk assessments are generally faster and less expensive while still providing useful insight into your cybersecurity posture.
#. Independent assessments: Because they are conducted by outside assessment specialists, independent assessments usually cost more and take longer, but they are more objective and thorough. Where time and resources permit, they are preferable even when an organization has deep cybersecurity experience.

Assessments can take a number of forms, but good ones are based on a highly-accepted risk framework, like ISO 27000 series, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, and the CIS Controls.

Goals
**********************************************

#.	Understand and determine the type and extent of cybersecurity assessment your organization should undergo
#.	Implement a risk assessment program
#.  Use the results to improve your cybersecurity posture

Actions
**********************************************

For |bp_title|, the necessary actions vary by maturity as detailed below.

Reactive Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

Keep it simple. If you haven't implemented the critical actions for the Reactive maturity yet, start with those. If you have, consider stepping up to vulnerability scanning or a risk and vulnerability assessment. Review the CISA's 'CyHy site<https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services>'_ or contact CISA at vulnerability_info@cisa.dhs.gov for more information.

Proactive Maturity
&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

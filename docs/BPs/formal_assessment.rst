The Essential Guide to Election Security
==============================================
*Best Practice:* |bp_title|
----------------------------------------------

Formal cybersecurity assessments are a fundamental aspect of managing cybersecurity risk.  Risk assessments can be sorted into two categories:
#. Self-assessments: In-house risk assessments are generally faster and less expensive while still providing useful insight into your cybersecurity posture.
#. Independent assessments: Because they are conducted by outside assessment specialists, independent assessments usually cost more and take longer, but they are more objective and thorough. Where time and resources permit, they are preferable even when an organization has deep cybersecurity experience.

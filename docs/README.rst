The Essential Guide to Election Security
=====================================

A Best Practices Resource for Election Professionals
----------------------------

As a follow-on to The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security, the Center for Internet Security (CIS) has developed the Essential Guide to Election Security to serve as a first-stop resource for election officials to learn about best practices in cybersecurity. This can aid the process of building a program.

The Guide takes special consideration of the wide range of technical capabilities and resource availability among the many thousands of election offices in the United States. It puts particular emphasis on helping small, often under-resourced election offices understand their security readiness and take incremental steps to improve.

Why does this Guide look like a webpage?
----------------------------

CIS published The Handbook for Election Infrastructure Security in early 2018, just prior to the launch of the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC). In 2021, CIS began working with the election community to update that handbook. One of the primary pieces of feedback we received was that the static nature of the Handbook meant it didn't include any of new and evolving the best practices that weren't already in place 2017. 

Simply creating an updated version of that Handbook would've left us in the same position: the pace of new best practices and services available to secure eleciton infrastructure is too great to have a static model for communicating them to election officials.

Instead, we decided to create this dynamic, always up-to-date online Guide. It can still be exported as one big PDF, but when you do so, you will get the best practices current as of the moment you the button to create the PDF.

We can also link to better content like videos and examples, and when things change, officials face new risks, or different resources become available, we can quickly update the Guide to reflect the new state of the world.

Who should use this Guide?
----------------------------

This Guide is developed to help election officials and their staffs understand their organization's cybersecurity readiness and take steps to improve. It is for jurisdictions of all of sizes and types, though which best practices apply to you will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:
* the type of jurisdiction (state vs county vs municipality), 
* the structure of election administration in a given state (top-down vs bottom-up), 
* the types of election equipment owned, and
* how IT responsibilities are shared with other functions in the jurisdiction (IT shared with the rest of the county).

Other stakeholders, like election technology providers, will find much of the information useful as they consider how their work impacts outcomes in election administration.
